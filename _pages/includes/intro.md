I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen(哈尔滨工业大学（深圳）)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html) in **Computer Science and Technology**.

My research interest includes **artificial intelligence for software engineering(AI for SE), data mining, natural language processing(NLP) and model compression**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cuiyun Gao](https://cuiyungao.github.io/) of Software Analysitics and Reliability Lab from HITSZ.

I am now actively pursuing admission to a **Ph.D. degree**. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at lvzongyi2002@gmail.com.
