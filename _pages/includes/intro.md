I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen(哈尔滨工业大学（深圳）](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html) in **Computer Science and Technology**.

My research interests include **artificial intelligence for software engineering(AI for SE), data mining, natural language processing(NLP) and model compression**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cuiyun Gao(高翠芸)](https://cuiyungao.github.io/) of Software Analysitics and Reliability Lab from HITSZ.

I will join HKUST as a full-time Ph.D. student in 2024 Fall, supervised by [Prof. Shing-Chi Cheung(張成志)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~scc/) and [Prof. Shuai Wang(王帅)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~shuaiw/). Cheers!
